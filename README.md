This repository serves as a home for the data and analysis code for the paper:

**“Excitation–inhibition interactions mediate firefly flash synchronization”**  
*(doi incoming)*

## Motivation & Overview

Natural populations of synchronous fireflies are well-known examples of collective behavior. This project investigates whether and how individual fireflies of species *Photuris frontalis* respond to external periodic driving signals delivered via LEDs. The goal is to test for differential levels of **entrainment** or **phase-locking** as a response to LED perturbation, and to quantify how the frequency of the driving stimulus alters firefly flashing behavior.

Specifically, we analyze open-loop experiments in which fireflies receive a periodic visual stimulus but do not influence LED timing. For each experimental trial, we extract the firefly period and phase to ultimately produce phase response curves (PRCs).

These metrics are compared against simulations using phenomenological PRC models and integrate-and-fire style oscillators to characterize excitation–inhibition dynamics governing flash timing.

### Description of key directories / files

- **arduino/** — Class and header file defining the LED flash pattern generator. Before use, the operator can change the LED period parameter as needed and deploy to an Arduino Uno or Nano, connected to an LED as defined below, to produce the light patterns. 
- **data_paths/** — All experimental flash-timing data in CSV format. Each file is coded by the date and LED period as well as a unique index, of the form <MMDDYYYY_LEDPERIOD_INDEX>.csv. Within each file is a list of firefly time/state tuples and LED time/state tuples, representing the timeseries for the firefly (off=0, flash=1) and the timeseries for the LED (off=1, flash=2), respectively 
- **figs/** — Saved static and interactive figures; `timeseries/` contains HTML representations for exploratory analysis.
- **helpers/** — Common plotting functions, period histogram utilities, statistical aggregation tools, file I/O helpers. Additionally the folder ```preprocessing``` containing the video analysis code.
- **simulation/** — Code to simulate PRCs, entrainment, and frequency responses; includes saved model parameters from simulation.
- **temp_data/** — Contains environmental metadata (temperature, etc.) associated with trials.
- **led_analysis.py** — Main driver script, for reproducing all analytical steps and generating figures, with many additional flags and functionalities off of the main code path for exploring alternate aspects of the data.

## Dependencies / Built With

Developed in **Python 3.9** with the following packages:

```NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly```

You can install dependencies via:

```pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly  ```

## Usage
``` 
python led_analysis.py -w -a \
  --do_ffrt \
  --re_norm \
  --save_folder ./figs/
```

This will:

1. Load raw experimental data
2. Generate interactive timeseries
3. Generate PRCs and period ratio plots
4. Produce IFI distributions
5. Save all figures to ./figs/ and ./figs/timeseries

```
python led_analysis.py 
  -s \
  --led_periods_ms 300 400 500 600 700 770 850 1000 \
  --simulation_trials 50 \
  --save_sim_data
```

This will:

1. Run 50 trials of the response curve simulation 
2. Generate comparative plots
3. Save all figures to ./figs/

## Arduino setup
Below are some basic instructions for reproducing the LED setup.
The breadboard should place 38k ohms of resistors and a YSL-R531Y5C-5v yellow (565-585nm) LED from sparkfun in series.
To wire the LED, connect an Arduino Uno to the breadboard with a wire in port 5 as the output and a wire in ground.
Wire the output to a spot on the breadboard prior to the resistance and then wire to the ground after the LED.
Modify the LED period parameter in the code to be what you are seeking, and then simply upload the code to the Uno and it will flash like a single frontalis.
There is a small delay before the flashing begins, in which you can set up the experiment, allow for natural period flashes, etc.

## Reproducing the revision analyses (Table 2, Supplementary Figures S4–S6, S8–S10)

The `analyses/` folder contains the scripts that generate the statistics and
supplementary figures added during peer review. They read the raw flash-timing
CSVs in `data_paths/` through a shared loader (`analyses/lib/data_loader.py`)
that re-implements the PRC scope and midpoint-selection rule of
`helpers/plotting_helpers.py::analyze_firefly_led_synchronization`.

```
cd analyses
python scripts/B1_ifi_stats.py                 # Table S2 statistics, Supplementary Fig. S4
python scripts/B2_pulses_per_ifi.py            # Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S5
python scripts/B3_predictor_sensitivity.py     # Supplementary Fig. S9
python scripts/B5_habituation_correlation.py   # Supplementary Fig. S8
python scripts/B6_locking_ratios.py            # Supplementary Fig. S7
python scripts/B9_strict_scope_prc.py          # Supplementary Fig. S10 (single-pulse / stratified PRC)
python scripts/B10_cluster_bootstrap.py        # Supplementary Fig. S6 (trial-level bootstrap CIs)
```

Each script writes its numerical output to `analyses/results/*.csv` and its
figure to `analyses/figs/`. `B4_variance_bands.py` is the pooled-cycle
bootstrap used in the first revision and is superseded by `B10`. Requirements
are the same as for the main driver (NumPy, SciPy, pandas, Matplotlib).
The code state used for the second revision is frozen as the tagged release
`v1.1-R2`.
